Sidecar also attaches to notebook kernels.\r\n\r\nStart up a console:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ jupyter console\r\n```\r\n\r\nFire up sidecar (from within the cloned and built directory):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm run start\r\n```\r\n\r\nSidecar will open as many display areas as there are kernels running, which means if you run\r\n\r\n```\r\njupyter console\r\n```\r\n\r\nin separate terminals, sidecar views will pop up automagically.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nThis package requires node or [iojs](https://iojs.org/en/index.html), [zmq](http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software), and [`jupyter_console`](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_console) (soon to be released).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you'll need `node-gyp`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g node-gyp\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter cloning this repository and `cd`ing into the directory, run this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm run build\r\n```","google":"UA-37362544-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
